This sketch will enable you to create a button box with:
a 16 digit keypad
4 latching switches
2 momentary switches
It also provides mouse input using a small trackball as was found on BlackBerry phones such as the Pearl and Curve.

This sketch will only work with the Arduino Leonardo or Pro Micro boards and requires the Joystick 2.0 Library to be installed.
