# DIYGameControllers.win
Code bank for projects found on https://diygamecontrollers.win

This repository is a place for all of the code used in projects featured on the diygamecontrollers.win blog.  Presently there are mainly snippets that work with the Arduino Joystick 2.0 library and as with the library itself they are only compatible with the Arduino Leonardo and Arduino Pro Micro boards.

The unless a sketch is in a folder labeled for the Uno or Mega it is a safe bet to assume that the code will not work with either board.  In fact it is safe to assume that anything Arduino in here, (sketches, code, snippets, library's) will only be compatible with the Arduino Leonardo and Arduino Pro Micro.


If you improve on anything here or have something you'd like to share that you believe would be useful, pull requests are always welcomed.
