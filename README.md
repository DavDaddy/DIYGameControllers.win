# DIYGameControllers.win
Code bank for projects found on https://diygamecontrollers.win

This repository is a place for all of the code used in projects featured on the diygamecontrollers.win blog.  Presently there are mainly snippets that work with the Arduino Joystick 2.0 library and as with the library are intended to be used with the Arduino Leonardo and Arduino Pro Micro boards.

The unless a sketch is in a folder labeled for either the Uno or Mega it is a safe bet that the code will only work with the Leo and Pro Micro
boards.

If you improve on the code here pull requests are always welcomed.
